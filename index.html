            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The history of Git started when Linux began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. The linux community enjoyed BitKeeper but after about 4 years of price free access to the BitKeeper tool, the policy was revoked, causing a lot of uproar in the linux creative community. This need for a free distributable software is what created BitKeeper. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike other VCS', Git stores and updates information whenver a file is changed but also takes a "snapshots" of the files before the change is made. Why is this a good thing? Well, when working on huge projects or programs, being able to look back at how the program looked before someone made changes to it is very useful for finding bugs and errors, correcting mistakes, group collaborations etc. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Like I stated in the past highlight, Git and other VCS' can be very useful for big group projects. Lets say you want to make a massive fantasy role playing video game like Skyrim or something like that. From a programmer's perspective, that is an insane amount of work because of all the little things that make the game whole. Running maintenance on a game like this sounds like a nightmare, but with VCS' like Git, its easy to go back and forth to see what people have changed exactly where they changed them. Companies like apple and samsung use VCS' like Git to create proper software updates. It can even be used by freelance programmers to show their clients "Hey this is what I changed about this thing you had me fix. Here is the before and here is the after." Pretty neat stuff.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When importing the my lesson 3 page to Git, I was instructed to use a number of commands to link my Cloud9 files into Git. Before using code we had to link our Cloud9 account to our Git account. This was easy, as cloud9 gives you the option to do so in its settings. After doing that we copied an SSH key into Git that connect Cloud9 to the private Git Repository. Next we configured Git within Cloud9 and then moved the page files into the local repository using the following lines of code. $ git config --global user.name “Steven Centeno” $ git config --global user.email “sjc15d@my.fsu.edu”. $ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m ‘first commit for lesson 3’</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has made strides to prove its worth in not only the development community, but also in the business world. When it comes to keeping databases, websites, business programs updated and running, group collabortion is essential when working on such a massive scale. Git makes it easy for project managers to ensure the task is being completed in a timely, effienct manner, while also being able to view if the project is going in the direction it should be. Git and group collaboration is changing the way technology works in today's businesses. </p>
